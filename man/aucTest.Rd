\arguments{
\item{x}{(\code{numeric})\cr reference/standard diagnostic assay.}

\item{y}{(\code{numeric})\cr test diagnostic assay.}

\item{response}{(\code{numeric} or \code{factor})\cr a vector of responses to represent
the type of classes, typically encoded with 0(controls) and 1(cases).}

\item{h0}{(\code{numeric})\cr a specified hypothesized value of the margin between
the two assays, default is 0 for difference method. If you select the
non-inferiority method, the \code{h0} should be negative value. And if select
superiority method, then it's non-negative value.}

\item{conf.level}{(\code{numeric})\cr significance level between 0 and 1 (non-inclusive)
for the returned confidence interval.}

\item{method}{(\code{string})\cr string specifying the type of hypothesis test,
must be one of "difference" (default), "non-inferiority" or "superiority".}

\item{...}{other arguments to be passed to \code{\link[pROC:roc]{pROC::roc()}}.}

\value{
A \code{RefInt} object contains relevant results in comparing the paired
ROC of two-sample assays.

This function compares two AUC of paired two-sample diagnostic assays by
standardized difference method, which has a little difference in SE calculation
with unpaired design. In order to compare the two assays, this function provides
three assessments including 'difference', 'non-inferiority' and 'superiority'.
This method of comparing is referred from Liu(2006)'s article that can be
found in reference section below.
}
\details{
If the samples are not considered independent, such as in a paired design,
the SE can not be computed by the method of Delong provided in \code{pROC} package.
Here the \code{aucTest} function use the standardized difference approach from
Liu(2006) publication to compute the SE and corresponding hypothesis test
statistic for a paired design study.
\itemize{
\item \code{difference} is to test the difference between two diagnostic tests, the
default h0 is zero.
\item \code{non-inferiority} is to test the new diagnostic tests is no worse than the
standard diagnostic test in a specific margin, but the same time maybe it's
safer, easier to administer or cost less.
\item \code{superiority} is to test the test the new diagnostic tests is better than the
standard diagnostic test in a specific margin(default is zero), having better efficacy.
}
}
\note{
The test of significance for the difference is not equal to the result of EP24A2
Appendix D. Table D2. Because the Table D2 uses the method of Hanley & McNeil
(1982), whereas this function here uses the method of DeLong et al. (1988), which
results in the difference of SE. Thus the corresponding Z statistic and P value
will be not equal as well.
