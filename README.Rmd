The `mcradds` R package is a complement to `mcr` package, contains common and solid functions for designing, analyzing and visualization in In Vitro Diagnostic trials. Most of the methods and algorithms refer to CLSI recommendations and NMPA guidelines.

The package provides a series of typical functionality, as shown below:

- Regression methods in method comparison
- Bland-Altman analysis and plots for numeric data
- Outlier detection, including 4E method from EP09A2 and ESD method from EP09A3
- Correlation, adding hypothesis test and confidence interval 
- Estimating bias in medical decision level
- Computing Reference Range/Interval from CLSI EP28-A3 or NMPA guideline
- ROC/AUC for non-inferiority trials
- Diagnostic accuracy criteria
- Precision analysis
- Descriptive statistics, proportion/ratios

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("kaigu1990/mcradds")
```

See package vignettes `browseVignettes(package = "mcradds")` for usage of this package.
