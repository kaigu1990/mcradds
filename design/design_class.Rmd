This vignette explores what could be a good class inheritance design in the `mcradds` package.

## Objectives

This package is a complement to `mcr`, so it means we can select the same class structure as `mcr`package. Or we just want to fast develop, so S3 class could be a choice.
- S4 class, similar with `mcr` package.
- S3 class, fast to develop.

We need to deal with two data categories, quantitative and qualitative data, such as:
- `c(1, 2, 3)` as quantitative value of one measurement method.
- `c("Positive", "Negative")` as the qualitative value of one measurement method.

Below methods will be implemented in above two data categories.
- quantitative data:
  - Descriptive statistics, frequencies.
  - Regression methods, rely on `mcr` package.
  - Bland-Altman for quantitative data, refers to CLSI EP09.
  - Outlier detection for quantitative data, refers to CLSI EP09-A2/A3.
  - Medical Decision Level, rely on `mcr` package, and summary the results.
  - Reference Range/Interval, refers to CLSI EP28-A3, or NMPA guideline.
  - ROC/AUC, wraps the `pROC` package.
  - Correlation
- qualitative data:
  - Descriptive statistics, proportion/ratios.
  - Diagnostic Accuracy Criteria for quantitative data, refers to CLSI EP12-A2.
  - ROC/AUC, wraps the `pROC` package.

Figures can be displayed by some simple functions, like `boxplot`, `scatterplot` and so on.

Adds functions to calculate the sample size for quantitative and qualitative trials, following the NMPA guidance's recommendation.














## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
